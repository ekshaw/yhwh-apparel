        “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered
        up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field” Matthew 13:44
        <br />
        <br />
        How do we hold fast to the treasure of knowing Jesus in our hearts? We treasure our jobs,
        grades, money, vanity, reputations, relationships, intelligence, etc. but what does it mean
        to live with eternity in mind? How do all these compare with the treasure of experiencing
        the amazing love of Christ? To fight our spiritual amnesia is to remember how precious and
        life-giving the gospel is and to hold it as our identity first and foremost.

        YHWH Apparel was built on the a love made known, a need that was seen, and a call that was
        heard. Before we are a clothing company, we are followers of God—a family of brothers and
        sisters united in Christ.
        <br />

        There is nothing we do that isn’t built on the love of God, and we remind ourselves that it
        is in Christ alone that we find our purpose and mission. We exalt Him; we rely on Him alone.

        “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you
        are with me...” Psalm 23:4
        <br />
        <br />
        The deliverances of God are constant. In the darkest depths of our lows, the highest of our
        highs, and even in the seemingly mundane moments of our everyday lives, the Lord continues
        to deliver us from the grips of sin. As long as we place our assurance in Him, we praise Him
        that there is no trial, no strife, and no pain which the Lord cannot deliver us from.

        fail and the fields yield no food, the flock be cut off from the fold and there be no herd

        Habakkuk 3:17-18

        Assurance is not the idea that God will make our lives better, nor does it exist to serve
        our own purpose and enjoyment. Our assurance isn’t found in more favorable circumstances.
        Rather, our assurance is in Jesus.

        “Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off
        everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with
        perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter
        of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down
        at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured such opposition from
        sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.” Hebrews 12:1-3
        {/* <h3>
          Jesus endured verbal and physical mockery and hatred during his life
          on earth. He was ultimately given a criminal death sentence, and was
          crucified on a cross. Jesus endured it all for our sake. He saw joy in
          his sufferings because his death was the means to sanctify us and
          justify our eternal salvation. Jesus’ crucifixion tore the veil
          between us and God, paid for all our sins, and made a way for us to be
          reunited with our Heavenly Father.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          As Christians, we look forward to the finish line of our race: to be
          with our Father in Heaven. God knows this journey isn’t easy; the
          burdens and sins of this world are heavy. That is where Jesus becomes
          our living hope. We are promised that Jesus is the “founder and
          perfecter of our faith” (v2) and that He endured the cross so that we
          would “not grow weary or fainthearted” (v3). He is our strength when
          we are tired from carrying life’s burdens and fighting sin’s
          temptations. This is our expectation as we tread through the mountains
          and valleys of life.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          So, brothers and sisters, be encouraged by the everlasting promise and
          presence of our Heavenly Father and Lord. Let’s run this race with

        <br />
        Adonai is the Hebrew word for “Lord,” a title that expresses God’s supreme sovereignty and

          of God’s glory. In Revelation 4, John sees a rainbow around the
          throne, with twenty-four celestial elders bowing down and casting
          their crowns at the feet of the Lord. John looks and sees four strange
          “living creatures,” each celebrating the might and authority of God,

        In Luke 15, Jesus tells three parables to illustrate God's heart for the lost. A shepherd
        who seeks and finds a lost sheep in the open field, a woman finding a lost coin, and a
        father running to embrace his lost son.
        <br />
        <br />
        When we have faith in the finished work of Jesus, He restores us from our lostness by giving
        us a new name, a new hope, and a new life that is secure in His steadfast love. By faith
        alone in Christ alone, we are <b>found by YHWH.</b>

        According to Isaiah, “we all, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his
        own way” (Isaiah 53:6). He declares that “there is none who does good, not even one” (Psalm
        14:3). The apostle Paul warns that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God”
        (Romans 3:23). We are lost because we, by the sin of our hearts, have turned away from Him.
        Like the prodigal son of Jesus’ parable, we seek to define good for ourselves and so
        squander the life we are given. */}
        {/* <h3>
          But Jesus “came to seek and to save the lost” (Luke 19:10). We are
          fallen creatures with no innate hope of restoring ourselves into the
          Father’s household; the best we can aim for in our own strength—like
          the prodigal son—is to be a slave (Luke 15:19). But God, the merciful
          Father, sent His Son Jesus to humbly take on our weak frame
          (Philippians 2). And being wholly without sin, Jesus offered Himself
          as a sacrifice on the cross to take the punishment we deserved for
          turning away from the Father. On the third day, He rose again and
          ascended into heaven (Luke 24).

          Father (Galatians 4). And so He restores us from our lostness by
          giving us a new name, a new hope, and a new life that is secure in His

        To be holy means to be S E T // A P A R T, to be completely distinct, to be in a class of

        everything else. From the beginning, God created and set apart humanity to bear His image
        and display His holiness to all of Creation, but we rebelled in sin and we fell short of His
        glory. (Genesis 1:26-27, Romans 1:25, Romans 3:23)

          In love and grace, God sent His Son Jesus to live a perfectly
          righteous life, which He gave up on the Cross to take on the wrath
          that humanity deserved for falling short of God’s perfect standard of
          holiness. (1 John 4:9-10) In His death and resurrection, Jesus took
          away our sin and declared us righteous, so that we would no longer be
          slaves to sin but children of God. (Colossians 2:13-14, 2 Corinthians
          5:21, Romans 8:1-17)

        <p>Run With Endurance</p>
        <p>
          “Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us
          throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let
          us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus,
          the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross,
          scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider 
          him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and
          lose heart.” Hebrews 12:1-3
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus endured verbal and physical mockery and hatred during his life on
          earth. He was ultimately given a criminal death sentence, and was crucified
          on a cross. Jesus endured it all for our sake. He saw joy in his sufferings
          because his death was the means to sanctify us and justify our eternal salvation.
          Jesus’ crucifixion tore the veil between us and God, paid for all our sins, and
          made a way for us to be reunited with our Heavenly Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Christians, we look forward to the finish line of our race: to be with our
          Father in Heaven. God knows this journey isn’t easy; the burdens and sins of
          this world are heavy. That is where Jesus becomes our living hope. We are promised
          that Jesus is the “founder and perfecter of our faith” (v2) and that He endured
          the cross so that we would “not grow weary or fainthearted” (v3). He is our strength
          when we are tired from carrying life’s burdens and fighting sin’s temptations.
          This is our expectation as we tread through the mountains and valleys of life.
        </p>
        <p>So, brothers and sisters, be encouraged by the everlasting promise and presence of our
        Heavenly Father and Lord. Let’s run this race with endurance.</p>

          have set Your glory above the heavens.” Psalm 8:1
        </p>
        <p>
          Adonai is the Hebrew word for “Lord,” a title that expresses God’s

          In Isaiah 6, Isaiah gets transported to the heavenly throne room of
          God, where he sees the Lord “high and lifted up,” surrounded by
          seraphim—angels ablaze from flying so close to the blinding radiance
          of God’s glory. In Revelation 4, John sees a rainbow around the
          throne, with twenty-four celestial elders bowing down and casting
          their crowns at the feet of the Lord. John looks and sees four strange
          “living creatures,” each celebrating the might and authority of God,
          and all the hosts of heaven worshiping in an endless chorus.

          Philippians 2 tells us: “Jesus humbled Himself by becoming obedient to
          the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly
          exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name that is above every name, so
          that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on
          earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ
          is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”

          Jesus was triumphant over sin and death when He rose again. He is Lord
          over the heavens and the earth, the promised King who reigns forever.
          When we are afraid, confused, or downtrodden, we fix our eyes on the
          One seated on the throne, who is in total control, and whose love
          never fails.

        <p>Found by YHWH</p>
        <p>
          In Luke 15, Jesus tells three parables to illustrate God’s heart for
          the lost. The first is of a shepherd who seeks and finds a lost sheep
          in the open field. In the second, a woman finds a lost coin in her
          home. And in the final, most dramatic parable, a father comes running
          to embrace his lost son.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the prophet Isaiah, “we all, like sheep, have gone
          astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way” (Isaiah 53:6). The
          psalmist declares that “there is none who does good, not even one”
          (Psalm 14:3). And the apostle Paul warns that “all have sinned and
          fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). We are lost not because
          God has misplaced us, but because we each, by the sin of our hearts,
          have turned away from Him to gratify ourselves. Like the prodigal son
          of Jesus’ parable, we seek to define good for ourselves and so
          squander the life we are given.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jesus “came to seek and to save the lost” (Luke 19:10). We are
          fallen creatures with no innate hope of restoring ourselves into the
          Father’s household; the best we can aim for in our own strength—like
          the prodigal son—is to be a slave (Luke 15:19). But God, the merciful
          Father, sent His Son Jesus to humbly take on our weak frame
          (Philippians 2). And being wholly without sin, Jesus offered Himself
          as a sacrifice on the cross to take the punishment we deserved for
          turning away from the Father. On the third day, He rose again and
          ascended into heaven (Luke 24).
        </p>
        <p>
          When we have faith in the finished work of Jesus, the Good Shepherd
          who laid His life down for His sheep (John 10:1-18), we are set free
          from the bondage of sin and adopted as sons and daughters by God the
          Father (Galatians 4). And so He restores us from our lostness by
          giving us a new name, a new hope, and a new life that is secure in His
          steadfast love. By faith alone in Christ alone, we are{' '}

        <p>
          To be holy means to be S E T // A P A R T, to be completely distinct,
          to be in a class of one’s own. When God says that He is holy, He means
          that He is completely set apart from everything else. From the
          beginning, God created and set apart humanity to bear His image and
          display His holiness to all of Creation, but we rebelled in sin and we
          fell short of His glory. (Genesis 1:26-27, Romans 1:25, Romans 3:23)
        </p>
        <p>
          In love and grace, God sent His Son Jesus to live a perfectly
          righteous life, which He gave up on the Cross to take on the wrath
          that humanity deserved for falling short of God’s perfect standard of
          holiness. (1 John 4:9-10) In His death and resurrection, Jesus took
          away our sin and declared us righteous, so that we would no longer be
          slaves to sin but children of God. (Colossians 2:13-14, 2 Corinthians
          5:21, Romans 8:1-17)
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the Israelites of the Old Testament, Christians are the new holy
          nation set apart for and by God to demonstrate His own love,
          righteousness, and holiness to the rest of the world. Obviously, we
          are not perfect; we are still works in progress and we still carry
          brokenness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But God is not only faithful to save His people: He is faithful to
          sanctify, or to make us more holy by shaping us more into the image of
          His Son. We are being made perfect by the Holy Spirit until the day we
          -- from every tribe, tongue, and nation -- stand before Him complete:
          a people for His own possession.

          You, washed white as snow by the crimson blood of Christ, are S E T //

          All throughout Scripture, He reveals Himself. He is Jehovah Nissi, The
          Lord our Banner, when He gave the Israelites victory over the
          Amalekites (Exodus 17). He is Jehovah Jireh, The Lord Who Provides,
          when God provided a ram for sacrifice in place of Isaac (Genesis
          22:14). He is YHWH, the Lord our God, who is Presence (Exodus 3:14).
          He is Jehovah Rohi, The Lord Our Shepherd, as David declares our
          relationship to God as the sheep to the shepherd (Psalm 23:1). He is
          Jehovah Rapha, The Lord Who Heals, who preserves the Israelites from
          the diseases He puts on the Egyptians (Exodus 15:26). He was, He is,
          and He will be. We believe a God who is constant throughout time,

          Our faith has been built upon who we are, who we are made to be, and

          have created. Simply, we find a God who is holy, almighty, and worthy

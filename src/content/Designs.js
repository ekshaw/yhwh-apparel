        I AM - SET APART
        </p>
        <p>
         To be holy means to be S E T // A P A R T, to be completely distinct, to be in a class of one’s own. When God says that He is holy, He means that He is completely set apart from everything else. From the beginning, God created and set apart humanity to bear His image and display His holiness to all of Creation, but we rebelled in sin and we fell short of His glory. (Genesis 1:26-27, Romans 1:25, Romans 3:23)
        </p>
        <p>
        In love and grace, God sent His Son Jesus to live a perfectly righteous life, which He gave up on the Cross to take on the wrath that humanity deserved for falling short of God’s perfect standard of holiness. (1 John 4:9-10) In His death and resurrection, Jesus took away our sin and declared us righteous, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin but children of God. (Colossians 2:13-14, 2 Corinthians 5:21, Romans 8:1-17)
        </p>
        <p>
        Like the Israelites of the Old Testament, Christians are the new holy nation set apart for and by God to demonstrate His own love, righteousness, and holiness to the rest of the world. Obviously, we are not perfect; we are still works in progress and we still carry brokenness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But God is not only faithful to save His people: He is faithful to sanctify, or to make us more holy by shaping us more into the image of His Son. We are being made perfect by the Holy Spirit until the day we -- from every tribe, tongue, and nation -- stand before Him complete: a people for His own possession.
        </p>

          You, washed white as snow by the crimson blood of Christ, are <br/>
          S E T // A P A R T for the holy King. (Isaiah 1:18)

        Know the Lord your God.
        </p>
        <p>
          All throughout Scripture, He reveals Himself. He is Jehovah Nissi, The Lord our Banner, when He gave the Israelites victory over the Amalekites (Exodus 17). He is Jehovah Jireh, The Lord Who Provides, when God provided a ram for sacrifice in place of Isaac (Genesis 22:14). He is YHWH, the Lord our God, who is Presence (Exodus 3:14). He is Jehovah Rohi, The Lord Our Shepherd, as David declares our relationship to God as the sheep to the shepherd (Psalm 23:1). He is Jehovah Rapha, The Lord Who Heals, who preserves the Israelites from the diseases He puts on the Egyptians (Exodus 15:26). He was, He is, and He will be. We believe a God who is constant throughout time, consistent in His nature, and unchanging despite culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our faith has been built upon who we are, who we are made to be, and what we are called to do in Christ. But at the core of our faith, we find something surprisingly simple, despite all the complexities we have created. Simply, we find a God who is holy, almighty, and worthy of our praises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let our pursuit be discovering who He is.

         SELAH means to “pause and praise”, carefully weighing the value of what
				 has just been said. Our team created SELAH to remind ourselves to have a
				 posture of measuring the weight of the Word, pausing, and turning it back
				 into praise.

          To seek.

          Is to search after. 
        </p>
			  <p> 
          When the waves seem to be rising faster. When our heart seems tossed around.
					When we feel like we keep hitting the same wall over and over again. When there’s no
					improvement. In him. In her. In us. It leaves us tired and weary, beaten down. 
        </p>
		   	<p> 
          But in times like this, we MUST remind ourselves of His promises. Even if our
					mind can recite it, our heart may not truly believe it. But by praying and declaring
					His promises for us, we are speaking TRUTH over ourselves, so that darkness and hopelessness
					will not overcome us.

          We say we’re athletes, artists, students. We identify ourselves by
          personality type, and pride ourselves in being perceived as polite,
          good looking, or well-liked. We tell the world we go to this college, or
          we’re dating that person; We say, “Look at where I've been. Look at what
          I've done, and who I’ll surely become. This is who I am.” 
        </p>
				<p> 
          But at the core of it all, who are we really? 
        </p>
				<p> 
          When we grow up, and find ourselves without the comfort of our parents.
          When our brains can no longer function at the same level of creativity,
          when the things that once excited us begin to dull. When suddenly our
          personality or friends or circumstances are no longer the same as they once were.
        </p>
				<p> 
          When there is nothing left of ourselves that we can say or boast of. 
        </p>
				<p> 
          Know what you are. Know who you are. Know Whose you are.
					You are defined by the Maker.

          Beautiful, majestic King. He rules with grace, even when we cannot
          fathom the depths of His grace. 
        </p>
				<p> 
          He is powerful and strong. When He roars, the Earth trembles at His might.
        </p>
				<p> 
          He is gentle. His heart longs for intimacy with His people. 
        </p>
				<p> 
          He is the Lion of Judah, whose kingship was demonstrated
          through His conquering of sin and death at the cross. He is the Lamb
          who was slain, so that we may spend eternity with Him. He gives boldness
          to those who believe in Him, that they may have courage to overcome,
          saying “Fear not, for I am with you.” He has created a kingdom, and has called us
          to be co-heirs with Christ. He is the King of Glory, worthy to be praised.
          Holy, righteous, and bold.

        <p> 
          Mountains are often associated with sheer might--the idea that if only
					we had enough power, we could move huge obstacles. When we face trials
					that seem to exceed our strengths, let us instead surrender our
					inabilities at the feet of our Father, whose strength is made perfect
					in our weakness. From a distance, our daunting challenges seem unshakeable,
					but when we patiently put our trust in God and approach with His full confidence,
					we will begin to see how far He has moved our mountains.

        <p>
          For our first product, we wanted to establish our hope for YHWH
					Apparel: to proclaim the name of God. From beginning to the end, this is
					about our God. He is more than enough.
        </p>
				<p>
          Yahweh, the Hebrew name of God, translates to "I am who I am"
					(Exodus 3:14). We proclaim His holy name because He first beckoned us
					and He calls us His children.
        </p>
				<p>
          Don't simply wear this name on your chest. Take up your identity as a
					child of God. Wear it on your heart. Convey it in your words and actions.
        </p>
			 	<p>
          You are wearing the name of the Most High King. What will you say?
					What will you do?

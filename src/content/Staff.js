            "Hi, I'm Hannah and I'm a senior. I've been in YHWH since I was a wee freshman in 2016.
            Invited by a junior sister, I found YHWH to be a safe, fun, and supportive environment
            to explore my passions and creativity. YHWH also became a family to me, through every
            season of new people; it was a place where brothers and sisters have actively listened,
            encouraged, and loved me in my faith, especially when times are rocky. I love growing
            with these people every year and drawing near to God together. In my free time, I enjoy
            going on adventures with friends, trying new food, and reading fun books! "

            This is my first semester in YHWH and its been such a blessing and
            privilege to be apart of a team so dedicated to making a product that
            glorifies God. This team has showed me how I can use my skills and
            passions (in logistics, communication, and web design) to bring honor
            to God, and I am so grateful to have the opportunity to play a small
            part in His big plan. I joined because I felt so compelled to start
            conversations with my clothing and my appearance, and this semester has
            showed me how God works powerfully through the smallest things, whether
            it be a necklace or a jacket. In my free time,  I love dancing,
            playing volleyball, and exploring design."

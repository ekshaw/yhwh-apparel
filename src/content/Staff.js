            Joseph Kim has been a designer for YHWH since Spring 2018. He has a
            strong passion for helping Christians and non believers alike grow
            deeper in their knowledge of and ultimately love for God. Joseph
            joined YHWH to use design to communicate themes of God's character
            and plan of salvation through Jesus. His hope is that through YHWH
            Apparel's products, Christians would not only be bold in their faith
            through their outer appearance, but also equipped with Scripture in
            their hearts to better explain and live out the Gospel.

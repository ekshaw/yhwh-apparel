            Hi, I'm Hannah and a senior at Cal. I joined YHWH my freshman year
            and have been loving every season of it. I love binging sitcoms,
            funny puppy videos, and learning random facts from the Internet.
            Hope you are also encouraged by YHWH!

            Before leaving for the trip, we prayed to God that He would show us
            how He can work through His sons and daughters if they are obedient
            and put full trust in Him. There were many times throughout this
            trip where we felt like we were not equipped enough to carry out a
            certain evangelical task (teaching classrooms, jail ministry,
            drug/rehab center ministry), but God clearly reminded us that He
            does not call the equipped, but He equips the called. We had
            countless valuable conversations with the Filipinos and saw many
            people accept Jesus into their hearts on this trip. It was an
            amazing experience living at What The Bible Says Church and spending
            so much time with the members. It was eye opening for us to see how
            missional the church members are to their hometown and to see how
            willing they are to preach the gospel to their neighbors.

            Hello! I'm a senior in Presence and I've been a part of YHWH's
            operations team since Fall '17. I learn something new every semester
            working with YHWH and I'm really excited to see how the team will
            grow in the coming semesters! ðŸ™‚

            Hey everyone! I'm Joseph, and I'm a senior studying MCB and Data
            Science. I've been a part of YHWH for one year now, and I really
            enjoy that I get to represent what we're passionate about with the
            team. Outside of YHWH and school, I really enjoy fellowshipping with
            my friends, playing and watching soccer, and eating!

            Hey, I'm Peter, and I'm currently a junior at Cal studying Computer
            Science. I joined YHWH my sophomore year, and being a part of this
            team and community has been such a blast. It's been so amazing to
            see how we've been able to carry out God's mission through our
            apparel, and I'm so excited to see what lies ahead. Apart from YHWH,
            I love to play basketball, go snowboarding, and play guitar.

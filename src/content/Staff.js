              Hi! I‚Äôm Kristin :) A little bit about me: I‚Äôm a first year prospectively majoring in
              Data Science and Cognitive Science. I‚Äôm a INFP on the Myers Briggs scale‚Äîan introvert
              who thrives on one-on-one conversations, going out with friends, and her quiet time
              (reading, exploring new music, etc.). I joined YHWH last semester after falling in love
              with its mission of living out a bold faith, and I hope our products continue to capture
              unconventional aesthetics that can spark conversations and appeal to all audiences.

              Hello, I‚Äôm Enoch, a first year who is part of YHWH apparel‚Äôs marketing team and is
              currently studying statistics. I was first called to YHWH by the In The Waiting
              collection as I really liked the design of the hoodie and saw how YHWH seeked to
              proclaim God‚Äôs message continually through articles of clothing. I too wished to be
              part of something that worked to proclaim God‚Äôs wonders, and since joining YHWH, can
              confidently say I have no regrets as it is such a joy to be able to serve Him and
              connect with my fellow brothers and sisters. My passions including sports (baseball
              fan), lifting, and playing videogames. I enjoy meeting new people as well so always
              feel welcome to come and talk to me about anything.

            Hey, I‚Äôm Jaemin, a first year student majoring in psychology. I joined YHWH in hopes to
            be able to spread the love of God through a medium of apparel. Fashion has been a huge
            interest of mine, and YHWH was perfect opportunity to be able to combine the two of my
            passions together. Being a part of YHWH has been amazing, there is so much joy in serving
            God and his people. My hobbies include volleyball, playing games, and watching movies. I
            love hanging out with people and getting to know my brothers and sisters, so hit me up anytime.

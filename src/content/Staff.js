            Before leaving for the trip, we prayed to God that He would show us
            how He can work through His sons and daughters if they are obedient
            and put full trust in Him. There were many times throughout this
            trip where we felt like we were not equipped enough to carry out a
            certain evangelical task (teaching classrooms, jail ministry,
            drug/rehab center ministry), but God clearly reminded us that He
            does not call the equipped, but He equips the called. We had
            countless valuable conversations with the Filipinos and saw many
            people accept Jesus into their hearts on this trip. It was an
            amazing experience living at What The Bible Says Church and spending
            so much time with the members. It was eye opening for us to see how
            missional the church members are to their hometown and to see how
            willing they are to preach the gospel to their neighbors.

            wee freshman in 2016. Invited by a junior sister, I found YHWH to be
            a safe, fun, and supportive environment to explore my passions and
            creativity. YHWH also became a family to me, through every season of
            new people; it was a place where brothers and sisters have actively
            listened, encouraged, and loved me in my faith, especially when
            times are rocky. I love growing with these people every year and
            drawing near to God together. In my free time, I enjoy going on
            adventures with friends, trying new food, and reading fun books!"

            "I have long been a fan of YHWH’s cozy apparel and liked how boldly
            “Christian” the clothes were. I never pictured myself joining until
            I saw a pretty set of photos get posted on YHWH’s Instagram. I
            recognized a non-Christian friend of mine modeling the Adonai
            sweater, and my jaw dropped. Seeing my friend in that photo made me
            remember our greater goal as Christians to spread God’s Kingdom. I
            was reminded how clothing can send a message and start
            conversations. Not only that, but the aesthetics of the photo
            triggered my old love of taking photos. I was eager to channel my
            passion for photography into something productive and God
            glorifying. By default, I was put on the design team. I am a bit
            clueless when it comes to graphic design, and did not think I would
            be helping too much in designing our products. But God has shown me
            countless times how He uses weak people to make great things happen.
            My time at YHWH has already been such a blessing. There is so much
            symbolism and meaning that goes into our designs from the color of
            the fabric or why something might be embroidered. Each piece of
            clothing has so much thought put into it, and I am so proud to be
            part of such a hard-working team!"

            only hearing about how God has been working through each and every
            one of our lives, but also witnessing my personal growth in my

            This is my first semester in YHWH and its been such a blessing and
            privilege to be apart of a team so dedicated to making a product
            that glorifies God. This team has showed me how I can use my skills
            and passions (in logistics, communication, and web design) to bring
            honor to God, and I am so grateful to have the opportunity to play a
            small part in His big plan. I joined because I felt so compelled to
            start conversations with my clothing and my appearance, and this
            semester has showed me how God works powerfully through the smallest
            things, whether it be a necklace or a jacket. In my free time, I
            love dancing, playing volleyball, and exploring design."

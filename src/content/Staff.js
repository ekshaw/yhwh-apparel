              Hi! I‚Äôm Kristin :) A little bit about me: I‚Äôm a first year prospectively majoring in
              Data Science and Cognitive Science. I‚Äôm a INFP on the Myers Briggs scale‚Äîan introvert
              who thrives on one-on-one conversations, going out with friends, and her quiet time
              (reading, exploring new music, etc.). I joined YHWH last semester after falling in love
              with its mission of living out a bold faith, and I hope our products continue to capture
              unconventional aesthetics that can spark conversations and appeal to all audiences.

              Hello, I‚Äôm Enoch, a first year who is part of YHWH apparel‚Äôs marketing team and is
              currently studying statistics. I was first called to YHWH by the In The Waiting
              collection as I really liked the design of the hoodie and saw how YHWH seeked to
              proclaim God‚Äôs message continually through articles of clothing. I too wished to be
              part of something that worked to proclaim God‚Äôs wonders, and since joining YHWH, can
              confidently say I have no regrets as it is such a joy to be able to serve Him and
              connect with my fellow brothers and sisters. My passions including sports (baseball
              fan), lifting, and playing videogames. I enjoy meeting new people as well so always
              feel welcome to come and talk to me about anything.

            Operations team. This is my first semester in YHWH but I have already had a lot of fun
            getting to know the team because everyone has been very welcoming! :) I joined YHWH
            because I believed that this club‚Äôs mission was something different and more special, as
            everything that goes on in the organization is solely for the purpose of glorifying our
            Father God. Through YHWH, I wish to spread His word and help people experience the love
            that I received from God. In my spare time, I enjoy film photography, traveling, getting
            an iced matcha latte at Strada, and spending time with friends!

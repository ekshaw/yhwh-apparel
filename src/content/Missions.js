            Before leaving for the trip, we prayed to God that He would show us how He can work through His sons and daughters if
            they are obedient and put full trust in Him. There were many times throughout this trip where we felt like we were not
            equipped enough to carry out a certain evangelical task (teaching classrooms, jail ministry, drug/rehab center ministry),
            but God clearly reminded us that He does not call the equipped, but He equips the called. We had countless valuable
            conversations with the Filipinos and saw many people accept Jesus into their hearts on this trip.
            It was an amazing experience living at What The Bible Says Church and spending so much time with the members.
            It was eye opening for us to see how missional the church members are to their hometown and to see how willing they are
            to preach the gospel to their neighbors.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of our favorite moments on this trip was when we were sharing the gospel on a college campus. We approached 3 students that
            were waiting for their class to begin. We began going through the gospel track together and exploring different questions
            that they had about being a believer of Jesus. Unexpectedly, 7 more students joined in our conversation one by one with no
            effort on our part to gather them. Giving all glory to God, all 10 of these students accepted Jesus after our conversation.
            God is indeed in every corner of our world, and He has the power to transform the hearts of any human being no matter what
            race, ethnicity, or gender. This trip to the Philippines has given us a new perspective on God’s vastness and His ability
            to care for His children, no matter if they are in the Silicon Valley or in a doorless hut in the middle of the rainforest.
            Praise God!

            Our main ministry at San Telmo consisted of visiting a Christian rehab center and
            putting together VBS for the children during the day and an adult service for the families
            in the evening. Although we weren’t able to personally get to know individuals due to a
            lack of time and language barriers, it was encouraging to worship together with some of
            the believers there, knowing that by God’s amazing grace, we find ourselves united as one body
            through our hope in Jesus Christ. One realization we had was that though these Mexican
            brothers & sisters may appear “poor” from our proud American lens, they did not seem
            poor in their hearts, because of the fullness they experienced in Christ. On the flipside, it
            occurred to us that many of us from the States ought to become more
            poor (in spirit) before the Lord, despite being more “rich” economically.

            As we returned back to Berkeley from this short trip, it was easy to simply
            return to our clean and comfortable lives, forgetting the blessings of that weekend.
            But we pray that God will help sustain in us an ever-thirsty heart for
            Him and doing His will. When we find our earthly desires wane in light of who He is and want
            nothing more than to delight in Him wherever He places us, we know that God will be most glorified and we will be filled with the fullness
            of His joy.

          The trip will mainly consist of serving with the local missionary that has been in the tribe reservation for 18 years and also the local church in the reservation. We will be helping to spread the gospel through VBS for the children and also in street evangelism. We will be focusing on many children that are often raised by single parents or grandparents because either one or both members of their parents take government funding and spend it gambling.

            Isabella and Johannah will be sharing the gospel to Syrian refugees and native university students around the Athens area as well as partnering together with a local church to build an integration house that houses refugee families during transition periods.

            Johannah: I want to go because I have grown to see the reality that life is short and eternity is long, and the only worthy investment I can make is in people and their eternities. I want to share the treasure of the gospel with people in Greece, I want them to experience the love of Christ. Please pray that I may grow in dependence on God during this time and experience Matthew 6:33 and John 15:4 coming alive, that financial constraints or fears may not keep me from doubting that God is my perfect provider, that I may grow to better know and understand God's heart for people and vision for my life through this trip, that I may be challenged to have a sense of urgency toward the reality of heaven and hell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Isabella: I hope to help stir some spiritual conversations with the people I meet and better understand the Greek culture and the overall climate towards the Syrian refugees. Plainly, I am scared. I have never taken this leap of faith in my Christian life before.

            In Ireland, we will be planning outreach strategies with local missionaries and going out to various campuses to share the gospel with fellow college students. I am so passionate about the hearts of the Irish students because of an unfortunate trend in society where a lot of students know facts about Christianity, but have been let down by the church or have false ideas of who God is. This story parallels my great grandmother's story, and I saw God redeem her life, so I cannot wait to see what God will do in Ireland!
          </p>
          <p>
             Please pray that students in Ireland can be exposed to the truth about God through the support of local ministries, as well as Cru.

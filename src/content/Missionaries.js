        Before leaving for the trip, we prayed to God that He would show us how He can work through
        His sons and daughters if they are obedient and put full trust in Him. There were many times
        throughout this trip where we felt like we were not equipped enough to carry out a certain
        evangelical task (teaching classrooms, jail ministry, drug/rehab center ministry), but God
        clearly reminded us that He does not call the equipped, but He equips the called.

        Our main ministry at San Telmo consisted of visiting a Christian rehab center and putting
        together VBS for the children during the day and an adult service for the families in the
        evening. Although we weren’t able to personally get to know individuals due to a lack of
        time and language barriers, it was encouraging to worship together with some of the
        believers there, knowing that by God’s amazing grace, we find ourselves united as one body
        through our hope in Jesus Christ.

        The trip will mainly consist of serving with the local missionary that has been in the tribe
        reservation for 18 years and also the local church in the reservation.
        <br />
        <br />
        We will be helping to spread the gospel through VBS for the children and also in street
        evangelism. We will be focusing on many children that are often raised by single parents or
        grandparents because either one or both members of their parents take government funding and
        spend it gambling.

        Isabella and Johannah will be sharing the gospel to Syrian refugees and native university
        students around the Athens area as well as partnering together with a local church to build
        an integration house that houses refugee families during transition periods.

        Johannah: I want to go because I have grown to see the reality that life is short and
        eternity is long, and the only worthy investment I can make is in people and their
        eternities. I want to share the treasure of the gospel with people in Greece, I want them to
        experience the love of Christ.

        In Ireland, we will be planning outreach strategies with local missionaries and going out to
        various campuses to share the gospel with fellow college students. I am so passionate about
        the hearts of the Irish students because of an unfortunate trend in society where a lot of
        students know facts about Christianity, but have been let down by the church or have false
        ideas of who God is. This story parallels my great grandmother's story, and I saw God redeem
        her life, so I cannot wait to see what God will do in Ireland!
        <br />
        <br />
        Please pray that students in Ireland can be exposed to the truth about God through the
        support of local ministries, as well as Cru.

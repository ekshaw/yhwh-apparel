      The trip will mainly consist of serving with the local missionary that has been in the tribe reservation for 18 years and also the local church in the reservation. We will be helping to spread the gospel through VBS for the children and also in street evangelism. We will be focusing on many children that are often raised by single parents or grandparents because either one or both members of their parents take government funding and spend it gambling.

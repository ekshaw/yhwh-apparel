        Laundry Love aims to tend to the needs of the homeless in Berkeley, dealing with their
        material and immaterial ailments. We offer laundry services to alleviate the problems of
        sickness and poverty, and return to them a sense of dignity and self worth. By building
        these relationships of trust and care, we are then able to effectively share the Gospel of
        Jesus. Laundry must be done continuously, but grace saves a person forever. What better way
        to evangelize than to demonstrate the love given to us than by serving the least of us!

More than simply through the clothing we wear or produce, YHWH Apparel wants to take up this call in action alongside the rest of the Church. And YOU are the Church! As you labor for the Lord, we want to partner with you and support you in the specific mission God has given you. As you are faithful to your part, we also want to be faithful with what God has given us.',

          Laundry Love aims to tend to the needs of the homeless in Berkeley, dealing with their material and immaterial ailments. We offer laundry services to alleviate the problems of sickness and poverty, and return to them a sense of dignity and self worth. Laundry must be done continuously, but grace saves a person forever. The church grows through attraction, and what better way to evangelize than to demonstrate the love given to us by serving the least of us!

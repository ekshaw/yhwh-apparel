              classrooms, jail ministry, drug/rehab center ministry), but God
              clearly reminded us that He does not call the equipped, but He

              we weren’t able to personally get to know individuals due to a
              lack of time and language barriers, it was encouraging to worship
              together with some of the believers there, knowing that by God’s
              amazing grace, we find ourselves united as one body through our
              hope in Jesus Christ.

              with fellow college students. I am so passionate about the hearts
              of the Irish students because of an unfortunate trend in society
              where a lot of students know facts about Christianity, but have
              been let down by the church or have false ideas of who God is.
              This story parallels my great grandmother's story, and I saw God
              redeem her life, so I cannot wait to see what God will do in
              Ireland!
              <br />

              Please pray that students in Ireland can be exposed to the truth
              about God through the support of local ministries, as well as Cru.

                be done continuously, but grace saves a person forever. What
                better way to evangelize than to demonstrate the love given to
                us than by serving the least of us!
